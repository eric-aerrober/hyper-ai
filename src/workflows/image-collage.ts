        We will be generating a collection of related images for a given idea provided by the user.
        These images will form a coherent set of images that are related to the idea.

        The initial idea is: ${h.state.idea}
    `)

        prompt: `
            First we will work to explore the idea and try to turn it into a general concept for the images.
            Some examples of this below for what concepts could be created for various ideas:
            
            Idea: "Countries represented as monsters"
            Concept1: 
                - For each country, we create a mythical creature that represents that country's culture and history. 
                - Each creature is perceved as scarry and powerful, but also beautiful and unique. 
                - The collection focuses on making each picture hyper-realistic, mysterious, we ask the user which one they could beat in a fight.
            Concept2:
                - For each country, we choose the countries national animal and draw it as a very cute and friendly cartoon character.
                - We then add in a few changes to make the animal look more like a monster, such as adding extra eyes or teeth or horns. Staying cute is key.
                - Each image has a blank background and is drawn in a simple, cartoonish style. We ask the users which country monster they would want as a pet.

            Idea: $1 vs $1 Million meals
            Concept1:
                - We start with increasing orders of money, from $1 to $1 million ($1, $10, $100, $1000, $10000, $100000, $1000000) . . .
                - For each amount, we describe a meal that could be bought with that amount of money.
                - We then draw a picture of each meal, each one getting more and more extravagant as the amount of money increases. We ask the user which one is the best value.

            When considering the concept, also consider the style of the images and how they should be formatted. Here are some unique styles that could inspire you. Feel free to use these or come up with your own:
            - Drawn in a cartoonish style with bright colors
            - Shot from a low angle with a wide lens on a cannon camera
            - Hand drawn by a japenese calligrapher with ink and brush
            - Superimposed on a background of a starry night sky
            - Surreal and dreamlike made by paper machet and photographed in a dark room with a single light source
            - Cave paintings made with chalk on a blackboard
            - Stainless steel sculptures of each subject, photographed in a white room with a single light source
            - Sudio ghilbi style, with soft pastel colors and a focus on nature and the environment
            - Die cut stickers of each subject, photographed on a white background
                
            Each concept should give rise to a generation function of some sort. IE: "for each x, do y". This makes it easy to generate a collection of images that are related to the idea.
            Each concept should also include a description of how the images should be formated and what the whole collection should feel like.
            Each concept should include a call to action for the user to engage with the images in some way. Make the user want to see the images and interact with them. Options here are like "Which dish are you eating?", "Who is winning the fight", "Which monster would you want as a pet?", etc.

            Choose which concept you think is the most interesting. Interesting here means a few things:

            - The concept feels unique and soemthing that does not feel generic or overdone.
            - The concept ties into its call strongly and makes the user want to engage with the images.
            - The concept has a clear generation function that can be used to create a collection of images.

            Once the concept is chosen, we are going to use the generation function to create a collection of subjects.
            For the subjects you generate, make sure they are each unique and interesting in their own way.
            Aim for 7-14 subjects in the collection.

            Additionally, we are going to lock down the "style" of the image. 
            Each image in the collection should be styialized in the same way, layong out the same way, and have the same feel to them.
